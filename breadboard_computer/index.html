<p>During 2022 I built an 8-bit computer on breadboards using various digital logic ICs. The design was very similar to the one in Ben Eater&rsquo;s 8-bit computer series, except I upgraded the RAM from 16 addresses to 256. To accommodate this change, the RAM was made to have a 12-bit word, so the upper 4 bits could be used for the instruction, and the lower 8 bits could be used as the operand (needed 8 bits so the new RAM would be addressable). The 4 instruction bits were connected on a separate bus straight to the instruction register and decoding logic; this way the main 8-bit bus didn&rsquo;t have to be expanded when the ALU and registers remained 8-bit. The video below shows the computer running a simple multiplication program for 9 x 13. The values to multiply are stored in two different memory addresses so they can easily be changed.</p>
