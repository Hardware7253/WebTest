<p>This clock was a one-off gift I made for a friend. It has an RTC to accurately keep track of time, and its time is adjustable using the 3 mechanical switches. One of the toggle switches turns the clock on/off; the other switch toggles an alternate mode. The alternate mode displays one of the worldline numbers from Steins;Gate. The clock also features an anti-poison routing that runs roughly every 10 minutes to prevent nixie tube cathode poisoning. This feature works by cycling all the digits on each nixie tube for about 15 seconds.</p>
<p>The clock uses an STM32F103Cx microcontroller for its low cost and wide availability. I generally prefer STM32 microcontrollers because they are widely supported by the Rust community. Naturally, I used Rust to program the software for this project. To power the nixie tubes, I designed a boost converter to convert the 5V USB voltage to 170V. The nixie tubes were multiplexed by connecting their digits (cathodes) together; each digit had its own NPN transistor to effectively connect it to ground. Each tube&rsquo;s anode was connected using a PNP transistor (for high-side switching); only one tube is supposed to be on at a time. Each transistor&rsquo;s base is connected to a shift register&rsquo;s output; this way the entire display can be controlled over an SPI bus. To reduce ghosting on tubes that are supposed to be off, each cathode was connected together with a high-impedance resistor. Each functional block of the design is separated into a different PCB. This way I could reuse one of the components individually for future projects or easily replace a module if it breaks.</p>
<p>The case uses laser-cut stainless steel panels, which are secured to an internal 3D-printed frame. The case was designed in OnShape.</p>
